# demo-assets
This is a general purpose repository for file assets needed for demos where you must use a URL for importing a file
instead of being able to use a file on your local disk.

If you have a few related files, make a new folder and put them together.

### openweathermap252-swagger.json
[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) hosts REST services for the current and forecasted weather conditions for locations around the world.

The API definition [openweathermap252-swagger.json](./openweathermap252-swagger.json) was cloned from https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/IdRatherBeWriting/open-weather_map_api/2.5.2 and then ran through https://www.apimatic.io/ to convert from OpenAPI 3.0 to Swagger 2.0, which is more widely supported for importing.
